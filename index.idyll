    Fu-ska-zi emerged from the [U.S. ska scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ska#United_States) in the late 1980s. They had a profound impact on the music industry without ever joining a major label or breaking into _Billboard_'s
    Hot 100.


    Musically, Fu-ska-zi produced what would come to be known as a seminal post-hardcore sound.
    Dissonant guitars, complex rhythms, and dueling vocals combine in unorthodox song structures. Harsh tension breaks into blissful, melodic resolution.
    [br/][br/]
    Some listeners find the results off-putting, but Fu-ska-zi garnered a loyal following. They're respected by critics and report millions of records sold.

      Despite establishing the foundations of a new subgenre of punk music, Fugazi may be better known for their [Do It Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY_ethic#Punk_culture) mentality and adherence to ethical business practice while navigating the music industry.

      The _Washington Post_ [wrote of the band](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1993/08/01/punk-lives-washingtons-fugazi-claims-its-just-a-band-so-why-do-so-many-kids-think-its-god/6c56fef5-780a-4a6e-8411-8c6b407e1eed/) in 1993, “There are three facts about Fugazi you must know: It only plays shows where age IDs are not required. It charges $5 admission to its shows, always. It will never, ever sign with a major record label.”
  [/Step]
  [Step]
    Even after ticket prices crept up to a reported $10, Fugazi remained committed to creative independence.
    For the duration of their career they stayed on [Dischord Records](https://dischord.com/), the label that Fugazi's Ian MacKaye had co-founded in 1980 with Jeff Nelson, his bandmate in [Minor Threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_Threat).
    [br/][br/]
    In 2003 the _Los Angeles Times_ [wrote](http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/07/entertainment/et-kot7), “Ian MacKaye did not invent punk rock. But it's quite possible that he has done more than any other artist in America to advance its cause, shape its ethics and define its aesthetic over the last 23 years.”


    Fugazi's lyrics preach messages of [anti-consumerism](https://genius.com/Fugazi-merchandise-lyrics), [feminism](https://genius.com/Fugazi-suggestion-lyrics), and [social justice](https://genius.com/Fugazi-cashout-lyrics), and the band lived accordingly. During [a 1988 performance](https://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/washington-dc-usa-122988) of the song "Suggestion," MacKaye can be heard saying:
    [br/]
    [i]
    I read in the paper the other day about some young men, some 'boys' who were beating up gay men in a park.[br/][br/] Let me tell you now, I don't give a fuck what you are, but you do not beat up people for being gay; you do not beat up people for being black; you do not beat up people for being women; you do not beat up people period.
    [/i]
    The band is on an indefinite hiatus, but the message remains relevant. In 2015 Noisey [published an op-ed](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/rnwbww/fugazi-politics) titled, "Why Fugazi's Politics Are as Frighteningly Relevant Today as They Were in 1988."

    From 1987 to 2002 Fu-ska-zi played [Display value:showCount format:"d" /] shows, visiting every state in the U.S., in addition to touring in South America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.

    That's an average of
